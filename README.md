# Visualize Flickr Sharing Network
The project presents three visualizations as the analytical tools to study a userâ€™s sharing behavior. The three visualizations are respectively, the photo similarity network for a given photo, the comment network for a given user and the photo-type radial chart for a given user. The goal is to provide users with efficient visual analytical tools to help them better understand and manage their sharing behavior.
