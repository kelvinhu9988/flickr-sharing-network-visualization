                <h2>Photo Similarity Network</h2>
                <p>
                    This section tries to visualize the similarity network of a chosen photo.
                    An edge between photo nodes is formed when two photos either are uploaded by the same user or share same tags.
                    White links indicate same tags, pink links indicate being uploaded by the same user, and red links indicate a combination of both attributes.
                    User can mouse hover a photo node to see more information about that photo.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The radius of a user node indicates the total number of comments that the user has received from other users, which can be regarded as the popularity of that user.
                    The length of the edge connecting two user nodes indicates the time duration between the comment date and the current date.
                    So essentially, the bigger the user node is, the more popular the user is, and the shorter the edge is, the more recent the commenting activity is.
                    Since the data is outdated, the current date is assumed to be the most current comment date among all the outter users' comment dates.

                <h2>User Interaction Visualization</h2>
                <p>
                    This section focuses on visualizing a user's interaction with other users.
                    The interaction on Flickr mainly includes tagging and commenting.
                </p>
                <h3>• Who is commenting on your photo?</h3>
                <p>
                    The network shows the users who have commented on the photo(s) that the central user posted.
                    Similar to the photo similarity network, the radius of a user node indicates the popularity of that user and the length of the edge connecting two user nodes indicates the time duration between the comment date and the current date.
                    So essentially, the bigger the user node is, the more popular the user is, and the shorter the edge is, the more recent the commenting activity is.

                <h2>User Sharing Habit Visualization</h2>
                <p>
                    This section focuses on visualizing user behavior that can reflect a user's sharing habit.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                <h3>• What types of photos are you sharing?</h3>
                <p>
                    The radial chart shows the most common (at most 8) photo types that a user has posted.
                    The labels along the outer circle are the photo types.
                    The vertical axis encodes the number of times a particular kind of photo has been posted.
                    The arc segments are sorted in descending order.
                    User can click on the "Update" button to view the sharing habit of another user in the data.
